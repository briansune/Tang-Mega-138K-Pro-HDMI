# TangMega-138KPro-HDMI

## The default Sipeed example is very tedious and over engineering.

### This is an updated open source HDMI example based on GOWIN 19.9 EDA.

### This example is verified on both modified and default TangMeaga board.

# Resources Usage

We can see the resource usage is ultra low and the HDL design is distinct and understandable.
